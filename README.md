Air Pollution Prediction Using Machine Learning

Project Overview:
Air pollution is a critical environmental and public health issue, especially in India, where it contributes to various respiratory and cardiovascular conditions.
This project aims to develop a reliable machine learning model to forecast air pollution levels across Indian cities. By leveraging real-time data from India.gov,
this project provides actionable insights to policymakers, researchers, and the general public to combat air pollution effectively.


Objectives:

Accurately predict air pollution levels for critical pollutants such as PM2.5, PM10, NO2, SO2, and O3.
Evaluate multiple machine learning models to determine the best-performing algorithm.
Provide a user-friendly interface or API for real-time air quality predictions to aid decision-making.


Dataset
The dataset is sourced from the daily updated India.gov platform, featuring:

1. Characteristics: ID, country, state, city, station, last update, latitude, longitude, pollutant types, pollutant_min, pollutant_max, pollutant_avg.
2. Size: 3,305 data points.
3. Pollutants Covered: PM10, PM2.5, Ozone (O3), Nitrogen Dioxide (NO2), Carbon Monoxide (CO), Ammonia (NH3), Sulfur Dioxide (SO2).

Methodology
1. Data Collection: Real-time updates from the India.gov portal.
2. Preprocessing: Handled missing values with mean imputation and scaled features using MinMaxScaler.
3. Visualization: Generated charts and graphs to identify trends and outliers in pollutant distributions.
4. Encoding: Applied one-hot encoding for categorical variables.
5. Modeling: Evaluated the following machine learning algorithms:
   Random Forest
  Support Vector Machines (SVM)
  CatBoost
  Decision Tree
6. Evaluation Metrics:
   R-squared
  Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
  Mean Squared Error (MSE)

Key Findings:

The Support Vector Machine (SVM) model achieved the best performance with an R-squared value of 0.93, indicating a highly accurate fit to the data.
The project demonstrates that machine learning techniques can enhance environmental monitoring and decision support systems.

Deployment
The project is deployed as a Flask-based web application, offering predictions through an intuitive interface.
It supports decision-making in air quality management and public health interventions.


Future Scope:

Integrating satellite data and IoT networks to improve spatial and temporal coverage.
Exploring deep learning techniques for enhanced prediction accuracy.
Developing region-specific models tailored to unique geographical and meteorological conditions.
Expanding pollutant categories to include heavy metals and VOCs.
Incorporating early warning systems for vulnerable populations.
